This project involves the design and implementation of a custom operating system built from scratch, tailored for educational purposes and experimentation with low-level system programming. The OS, developed using C and Assembly, features a basic kernel capable of booting from an ISO image, managing hardware interactions, and handling essential system calls.

Key Features:
Bootloader: A simple bootloader that initializes the kernel and sets up the system environment.
Kernel Development: A monolithic kernel designed to handle fundamental OS tasks, including memory management, process scheduling, and basic I/O operations.
Filesystem Support: Implementation of a rudimentary filesystem to manage file storage and retrieval.
Shell Interface: A basic command-line shell that allows users to interact with the OS, execute commands, and manage processes.
ISO Generation: The OS is packaged as a bootable ISO file, making it easy to run on various emulators like QEMU or physical machines.
Technologies Used:
C and Assembly: Core development languages for implementing low-level OS components.
QEMU: Emulator for testing and debugging the OS in a controlled environment.
Makefile: Build automation tool to compile and link the OS components efficiently.
GRUB: Bootloader used to load the kernel and start the OS.
